                        Dolphins are very intelligent aquatic mammals. The natural systems that complement the dolphin's body are very complex. So a lot of technology is inspired by dolphins. One example is dolphin skin which can reduce friction with water, so that dolphins can swim with little water resistance. This is what swimmers use to design swimsuits that resemble dolphin skin.

                        Dolphins have a system that is used to communicate and receive stimuli called a sonar system. This system can avoid objects in front of the dolphin, thereby avoiding collisions. This technology was then applied in making submarine radars. Dolphins are mammals because dolphins are mammals. They live in the sea and rivers throughout the world. Dolphins are relatives of whales and porpoises. There are more than 40 types of dolphins.
                        
                        Newborn baby dolphins will be brought to the surface by their mother so they can breathe air. Dolphins need to rise to the surface to breathe to stay alive. Dolphins breathe through air holes located above their heads. Its sleek and slender body is very suitable for swimming. The mother dolphin feeds her child with delicious milk and provides the energy for her child to grow up quickly. Every baby dolphin is always near its mother, so that her mother can protect her from danger. Dolphins always maintain a relationship with their children until they grow bigger. Mother dolphins call their offspring with special whistles that they can recognize.
